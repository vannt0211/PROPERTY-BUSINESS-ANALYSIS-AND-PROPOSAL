# PROPERTY BUSINESS ANALYSIS AND PROPOSAL

As part of this specialization, I will complete a Capstone Project that applies data analysis to develop recommendations for improving the profitability of Watershed Property Management, Inc. Watershed manages thousands of residential rental properties across the United States. My objective is to advise the company’s leadership on a new property management strategy that can enhance overall returns.

Watershed currently has a time-sensitive opportunity to enter the short-term rental market in partnership with one of its major property owners. This client is interested in converting a portion of its long-term rental portfolio into short-term rentals. In my role as a business data analyst, I am responsible for:

(1) Estimating the costs associated with converting and maintaining each property as a short-term rental.

(2) Identifying the optimal nightly rental rates that would maximize profitability for each property.

Using these results, I will then:

(3) Assess which properties would generate higher profits as short-term rentals.

(4) Evaluate the overall financial impact of converting part of the client’s portfolio.

(5) Estimate the amount of upfront capital required to implement this strategy.

Finally, I will consolidate these findings into a concise business recommendation addressing the following questions:

Should Watershed expand into short-term rentals using this client’s properties? If so, which properties should be prioritized for conversion?

Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market using some of this client’s property portfolio, or not? If so, which properties should be converted first?
